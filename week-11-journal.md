" As part of the celebration of the 50th anniversary, and of Torrence's leadership of the journal, my contribution revisits these topics of archaeology's status as a science"

I do not think archaeology is a science in any way. There are too many differences between archaeology and a real sciene, like biology or chemistry.
Studies are the building blocks of science, which are all published with the hope that they can get replicated in another lab somewhere else to prove a certain theory.
Archaeology does not work like this. Finds from excavations are published, stratigraphy documented, techniques honed, but at the end of the day sites are completely unique to each other. Two identical sites will never exist, unlike chemistry where water will always react with sodium, for example.
Archaeology uses many scientific tools, especially in the last century, but the act of digging up things humans have interacted with is not a science.
