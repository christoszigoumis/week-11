I started off by trying the archaeological data service code in my Jupyter, but got the error message that the notes in the code had warned me off:

"Error in library(curl): there is no package called ‘curl’
Traceback:"

I wasn't sure where or how to progress from here however, even when I tried putting each line of code into a new cell like it told me to do.
